            <h1>Just another low blow- My winning blog</h1>

            <p>I feel we all live in a pool of sadness, with happiness equivalent to the amount of some sprinkled droplets. Or maybe it’s just me. Today is one such bad day. So, let us do something happy. Let us post a blog that I wrote for a competition.
            </p>

                Topic: What is the thing/activity that makes you feel like yourself (again)?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I open the tap gently and small hot droplets fall on my head and trail towards my body. Slowly as I turn the tap completely to the left hot water drops emerge with full force and I’m left to soak in them like a raisin by myself. Standing upright with a slight bend of head so that the water first falls on my head and then completely drenches my hair is me. As I stand there, I kept thinking about how unjust and ruthless my life gets at times. How the 100% that I put into something is also not enough. My knees felt weak, I slowly went down shivering and cried terribly as I sat under the shower with folded knees shoving my head in them. But then, I thought, it’s okay. Life happens. Opportunities come. Opportunities go. Shut some doors. But eventually redirect us to a better path or highlight some minor minuses that we can work on for the same path. Just like how we bump on mirrors in the mirror maze and then realize that our hands should look for the mirrors before our eyes. So, I guess we can only learn from mistakes. How else does one learn? As these thoughts unwind a pool of possibilities in which I could behave and perceive things, I think I’m a better person now. I cried, felt and dealt with it with a shower session.
                Yes. Shower. This is the activity that brings life and hope back in me. It gives me the best thermotherapy and a feathery feeling to be able to think about newer perspectives. Coming out of a nice boiling shower makes me feel in place and like myself again. To be honest bathrooms are the best escape places and a good thing about showers is that nobody can ever see you cry in them.

                Jennifer Lopez once said, and I quote
                “You’ve got to be okay on your own before you can be okay with somebody else.”

            To feel okay by myself I take showers and call it a therapy. Now, as I write this blog, I’m obliged to make note of this hobby of mine too. Yes, I maintain a personal blog. It is equally important to me. Every time a heartbreak kills everything that I feel is left in me, sometimes when something shocks or generates curiosity in me and rarely when I encounter a dramatic win, I write about it. Although I don’t upload everything I write, I still do write. I feel that reading my own writing will make me see things in plain sight that I unknowingly overlooked. Maybe I could read it repeatedly to myself and make me remind of how to be. Maybe the process of penning down could break down complex portions of my life and make them easy to understand. This way I can make less mistakes the next time. Sometimes when I’m confused with what to feel or encounter a roadblock I could just write about it. Strike a conversation between me and my dear brain and heart. Be a better me for me at least, to start with. These are my reasons to write a personal blog.
                Talking about both of the above activities, they make me feel like myself again and light a spark in me to see the upcoming day with positivity, zero regrets and a forgiving heart. We fall in love, fall out of love but this time let it be for ourselves. Let us make time for ourselves, take care of ourselves because ‘no soul will ever forget how you made it feel’, inclusive of our own.
