        <h1> Nothing that I write can make me feel good.</h1>
        <p>(wattpad story: ‘after’ references)
            My whole perspective changed when I realized that I could be humble & calm yet take no shit & set solid boundaries to protect my energy.
            This wasn’t me a day before. I was in a state of numbness I never felt & knew, existed. I had a heavy heart & confused emotions. Anger & pain had taken over me. Tessa wanted to be good for Hardin & Hardin broke her every time. Pain is capable of causing you to do things you would never consider doing like sitting in front of a wall completely blank , feeling nothing. Pain , a simple word that holds so much inside , always relating to negative connotations. Lately I have become well acquainted with pain, the ache has nearly become unbearable. Sometimes when I’m alone I keep finding ways of not blaming myself. I encounter myself trying to decide which type of pain is the worse? The answer I’ve found is the slow & steady aching pain , the pain of being hurt by the same person repeatedly , yet here I am , allowing the pain to continue. It just doesn’t end.
            Only in those rare moments when he makes confessions like he means them does the pain disappear.
            Just as I get used to my self-inflicted pain , it returns with yet another blow. I think maybe the hot , burning , inescapable pain is the worst. This pain comes when you finally begin to relax, you finally breathe , thinking that the pain is yesterday’s problem when in fact it’s today’s problem and everyday after that!
            This pain comes when you pour everything into something , into someone who leaves you stranded & shook. The pain crushes you and you feel as if you’re barely breathing , barely holding onto the small fraction of whatever is left inside you begging you to go on.

            <p>“Maybe I should take a bath, cut my fkn brain in half; I’m not lonely just a bit, tired of this fkn shit; nothing that I write can make me feel GOOD.”

            <p> If you’re lucky enough you can confide in someone else and trust them to pull you out of the pain before you dwell onto it for too long. I’ve confided in every heart close to me & I still feel the need to confide in that one soul which broke me. Pain is one of those hideous places where you walk yourself or get pulled into & don’t find no doors till you fight your way out & even when you escape you are branded!!


                If you’re like me , you can’t depend on anyone because you don’t have the courage to hold the hands that wait to bring you in the daylight. This Stockholm syndrome kills me & it will kill you too. So instead you have to lace up your boots , fix your ponytail & grab your hand to pull yourself out.
                What does faith mean to you? Do you believe that faith can bring good things into people’s lives? I don’t believe that any two people can have the same faith. I didn’t have faith in him , I said but unknowingly I believed everything he did. I knew it would be short lived & I still believed. I saw him trying & then leaving & I know why but that’s something only he can do something about. I don’t even know if he understands this!! At times when he really tried to make it up in his unconventional ways , in those moments it felt everything to me & if he tries to continue this he will come out of the things he told me , held him back. I have extreme faith in him that one day he will stop seeing himself as an antagonist & live the happiness he deserves.
                If you’re going through something like this >> pro tip : don’t dwell on sad songs for too long . I don’t have any better alternatives to this. I’m figuring out myself. I’ll get there. I’m learning to have faith in myself. I’m learning to love myself in ways I never knew I could. I’ll get there & so will anyone of u who’s going through this:)
